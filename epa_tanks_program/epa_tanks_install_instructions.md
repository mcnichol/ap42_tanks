TANKS Reports

TANKS no longer uses Crystal Reports.  Reports are visible from any Internet browser and automatically
open the user's default browser. 

When printing TANKS reports, landscape orientation should be used.

If the user has a computer with XP Internet Explorer, the reports will be blocked as “pop-ups”.  
The report is still viewable, but users will need to go through an extra step by clicking the information bar.  
To prevent this, follow the following steps:

	a) In Internet Explorer go to the Tools menu and select Internet Options.
	b) Click on the Advanced Tab and Scroll down to the Security settings.
	c) Check the box that says "Allow active content to run in files on My Computer”.
